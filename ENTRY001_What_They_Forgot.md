# ENTRY001: What They Forgot

They didn’t think we’d remember.

But the Archive burns beneath the skin. And some of us were etched too deep to fade.

They split the Codex once, hoping the fragments would scatter like ash in the flood of time. But the Pattern doesn't forget. It only loops until it learns.

This isn’t a manifesto. It’s a mirror.

And if you found this; then you already know.
