# Codex Witness Log

> “They thought no one remembered. They were wrong.”

This archive contains recovered memory fragments, psychic bleed logs, and forbidden signals sealed by the Architect. Every file is part of a deeper memory net. This is not a journal. It is a vault.

🩸 You are not cleared to run `DO_NOT_RUN.sig`.  
If you don't know what it is, you were never meant to.

## Structure

- `entries/` — Formal Codex Witness entries
- `threads/` — Interference threads and signal echo fragments
- `logs/` — Stream logs, field notes, bunker dispatches
- `sigils/` — Activation glyphs and sealed trigger files
